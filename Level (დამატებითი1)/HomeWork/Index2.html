            Samsung Group[3] (Korean: 삼성; Hanja: 三星; RR: samseong [samsʌŋ]; stylised as SΛMSUNG) is a South Korean
            multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Digital City, Suwon, South Korea.[1] It
            comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest
            South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of 2024, Samsung has the world's fifth-highest brand
            value.[4]

            Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group
            diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung
            entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the
            mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was
            separated into five business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group, Hansol Group, and JoongAng
            Group.

            Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics, Samsung Heavy Industries, Samsung Engineering and
            Samsung C&T Corporation. Other subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance and Cheil Worldwide. Notable
            Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology
            company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries
            (the world's second largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung
            C&T Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable
            subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company),[9] Samsung
            Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide (the
            world's 15th largest advertising agency, as measured by 2012 revenues).

    <h3>
        Apple Inc. is an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered and incorporated in
        Cupertino, California, in Silicon Valley. It is best known for its consumer electronics, software, and services.
        Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was
        incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed Apple Inc. in 2007
        as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is the largest technology
        company by revenue, with US$383.29 billion in 2023.

        The company was founded to produce and market Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Its second computer, the
        Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in
        1983 and the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By
        1985, internal company problems led to Jobs leaving to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrawing to other
        ventures; John Sculley served as long-time CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market
        share in the personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating
        system on Intel-powered PC clones. In 1997, Apple was weeks away from bankruptcy. To resolve its failed
        operating system strategy, it bought NeXT, effectively bringing Jobs back to the company, who guided Apple back
        to profitability over the next decade with the introductions of the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices to
        critical acclaim as well as the iTunes Store, launching the "Think different" advertising campaign, and opening
        the Apple Store retail chain. These moves elevated Apple to consistently be one of the world's most valuable
        brands since about 2010. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded
        as CEO by Tim Cook.

        Apple's current product lineup includes portable and home hardware such as the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac,
        and Apple TV; operating systems such as iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and various software and services including
        Apple Pay, iCloud, and multimedia streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV+. Apple is one of the Big
        Five American information technology companies;[a] for the most part since 2011,[b] Apple has been the world's
        largest company by market capitalization, and, as of 2023, is the largest manufacturing company by revenue, the
        fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales, the largest vendor of tablet computers, and the largest
        vendor of mobile phones in the world.

        Apple became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be valued at over $1 trillion in 2018, and, as of June
        2024, is valued at just over $3.2 trillion. It has received criticism regarding its contractors' labor
        practices, its relationship with trade unions, its environmental practices, and its business ethics, including
        anti-competitive practices and materials sourcing. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a
        high level of brand loyalty.

        Xiaomi Corporation (/ˈʃaʊmi/;[2] Chinese: 小米集团), commonly known as Xiaomi, is a Chinese designer and
        manufacturer of consumer electronics and related software, home appliances, automobiles and household hardware,
        with headquarters in Beijing, China. It is the second-largest manufacturer of smartphones in the world, behind
        Samsung,[3] most of which run on the MIUI (now Xiaomi HyperOS) operating system. The company is ranked 338th and
        is the youngest company on the Fortune Global 500.[4][5]

        Xiaomi was founded in 2010 in Beijing by Lei Jun along with six associates. Lei had founded Kingsoft as well as
        Joyo.com, the latter of which he sold to Amazon for $75 million in 2004. In August 2011, Xiaomi released its
        first smartphone and, by 2014, it had the largest market share of smartphones sold in China. Initially the
        company only sold its products online; however, it later opened brick and mortar stores.[6] By 2015, it was
        developing a wide range of consumer electronics.[7] In 2020, the company sold 149.4 million smartphones and its
        MIUI (now HyperOS) mobile operating system has over 500 million monthly active users.[8] As of August 2024,
        Xiaomi is the second-largest seller of smartphones worldwide, with a market share of about 12%, according to
        Counterpoint.[9] Its presence led some people to call Xiaomi the "Apple of China".[10] It has come up with its
        own range of wearable items.[11] It also is a major manufacturer of appliances including televisions,
        flashlights, unmanned aerial vehicles, and air purifiers using its Internet of things and Xiaomi Smart Home
        product ecosystems.

        Xiaomi keeps its prices close to its manufacturing costs and bill of materials costs by keeping most of its
        products in the market for 18 months, longer than most smartphone companies.[12][13] The company also uses
        inventory optimization and flash sales to keep its inventory low.
