    <h2 id="cola">Coca Cola</h2>
    <p>Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a cola soft drink manufactured by the Coca-Cola Company. In 2013, Coke products were sold
        in over 200 countries worldwide, with consumers drinking more than 1.8 billion company beverage servings each
        day.[1] Coca-Cola ranked No. 94 in the 2024 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by
        revenue.[2] Based on Interbrand's "best global brand" study of 2023, Coca-Cola was the world's sixth most
        valuable brand.[3]

        Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, Coca-Cola was invented in the late
        19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1888, Pemberton sold the ownership rights to Asa
        Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink
        market throughout the 20th and 21st century.[4] The name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves
        and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).[5] The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a
        variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. The secrecy around the formula has
        been used by Coca-Cola in its marketing as only a handful of anonymous employees know the formula.[6] The drink
        has inspired imitators and created a whole classification of soft drink: colas.</p>
    <h2 id="fanta">Fanta</h2>
    <p>Fanta (/ˈfæntə/) is an American-owned brand of fruit-flavored carbonated soft drink created by Coca-Cola
        Deutschland under the leadership of German businessman Max Keith. There are more than 200 flavors worldwide.
        Fanta originated in Germany as a Coca-Cola alternative in 1941 due to the American trade embargo of Nazi
        Germany, which affected the availability of Coca-Cola ingredients. Fanta soon dominated the German market with
        three million cases sold in 1943. The current formulation of Fanta, with orange flavor, was developed in Italy
        in 1955.</p>
    <h2 id="sprite">Sprite</h2>
    <p>Sprite is a clear, lemon-lime flavored soft drink created by the Coca-Cola Company. Sprite comes in multiple
        flavors, including cranberry, cherry, grape, orange, tropical, ginger, and vanilla. Ice, peach, Berryclear
        remix, and newer versions of the drinks are artificially sweetened. Sprite was created to compete primarily
        against 7-Up.</p>
