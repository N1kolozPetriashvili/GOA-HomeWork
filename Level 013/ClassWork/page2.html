    <h2 id="coconut">Coconut Donut</h2>
    <p>The coconut doughnut (or coconut donut) is a variety of doughnut in the United States and Canada that is usually
        covered or topped with shredded or flaked coconut topping. It is often toasted or broiled, and there are
        variations made with chocolate and, in a 1959 recipe, orange juice in the dough and icing.

        Coconut doughnuts are not usually filled, but there is an unrelated coconut doughnut that uses a coconut cream
        filling (like a Boston cream doughnut or jelly doughnuts).</p>
    <h2 id="chocolate">Chocolate Donut</h2>
    <p>For me, a good doughnut will always include a matte chocolate glaze and lots and lots of sprinkles. The pairing
        was a guilty pleasure as a child. Still is. Perhaps it’s because my doting father always let me sneak a few
        before Sunday school, under the strict orders not to squeal to mom. (Don’t worry, my mother and I shared a
        healthy obsession with chocolate malts, and the best place in town just happened to be located right next to my
        pediatric dentist. I swore I’d never tell.)

        I try to steer clear of doughnuts on a day-to-day basis, but that doesn’t mean I don’t take a loooong pause
        every time I pass a Krispy Kreme display. Every now and then a girl’s got to give in to her cravings, and with
        my doughnut pan gathering cobwebs on a shelf, it seemed like maybe it was time to give my old favorite a go.

        Now let me just clear the air early. Obviously I know that “real” doughnuts are fried, but I was daring to be
        different here. It’s all in the name of fun, right? (And y’all know this girl isn’t afraid of a little hot oil.)
        For the sake of this particular recipe, I wanted all the ease of baking with the same deep-fried flavors we know
        and love.</p>
