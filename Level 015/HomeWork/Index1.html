    <h1>Scream</h1>
    <p>
        Scream is an American murder mystery and meta slasher franchise that includes six films (and a seventh in active
        development), a television series, merchandise, and games.[1][2] The first four films were directed by Wes
        Craven. The series was created by Kevin Williamson, who wrote the first two films and the fourth, and will
        return to direct the seventh film. Ehren Kruger wrote the third. The fifth and sixth installments were directed
        by Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, with Guy Busick and James Vanderbilt serving as writers and
        Williamson returning as executive producer. Dimension Films produced the first four films. Spyglass Media Group
        took over the rights from the fifth film on with Paramount Pictures distributing. The film series has grossed
        over US$910 million at the global box office.

        Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Roger L. Jackson (who voices the various Ghostface killers)
        starred in the first five films. Cox and Jackson reprised their roles for the sixth and are the only cast
        members to feature in all films to date with Cox also being the only actress to appear in six consecutive films
        of a horror franchise.[3] Campbell is reprising her role in the seventh film. Hayden Panettiere stars in the
        fourth and sixth films, while Melissa Barrera, Jenna Ortega, Mason Gooding, and Jasmin Savoy Brown star in the
        fifth and sixth. Jamie Kennedy and Liev Schreiber feature in the first three films, Skeet Ulrich stars in the
        first and cameos in the fifth and sixth installments, Marley Shelton appears in the fourth and fifth, and Jack
        Quaid stars in the fifth and cameos in the sixth. Additionally, Heather Matarazzo makes cameo appearances in the
        third and fifth films, as does Nancy O'Dell in the second, third and fourth. Having appeared in the iconic
        opening scene of the first film and on its poster, Drew Barrymore is strongly associated with the franchise.[4]
        The series has also featured many notable actors making single-film appearances in supporting cast roles or as
        cameos.

        Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997), Scream (2022), and Scream VI (2023) received high praise from critics. Scream 3
        (2000) received a more mixed response, as did Scream 4 (2011), Craven's final film; both were later reappraised
        and the fourth film was generally seen as a return to form for the series. Commercially, the first three films
        and the fifth and sixth were high performers at the box office, while Scream 4 had a disappointing domestic
        run.[5] The film series has also been the recipient of several awards and nominations, including winning Best
        Movie twice at the MTV Awards (for Scream in 1996 and Scream VI in 2023).
