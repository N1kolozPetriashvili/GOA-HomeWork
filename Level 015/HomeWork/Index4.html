            Samsung Group[3] (Korean: 삼성; Hanja: 三星; RR: samseong [samsʌŋ]; stylised as SΛMSUNG) is a South Korean
            multinational manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Samsung Digital City, Suwon, South Korea.[1] It
            comprises numerous affiliated businesses,[1] most of them united under the Samsung brand, and is the largest
            South Korean chaebol (business conglomerate). As of 2024, Samsung has the world's fifth-highest brand
            value.[4]

            Samsung was founded by Lee Byung-chul in 1938 as a trading company. Over the next three decades, the group
            diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung
            entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the
            mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was
            separated into five business groups – Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group, Hansol Group, and JoongAng
            Group.

            Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics, Samsung Heavy Industries, Samsung Engineering and
            Samsung C&T Corporation. Other subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance and Cheil Worldwide. Notable
            Samsung industrial affiliates include Samsung Electronics (the world's largest information technology
            company, consumer electronics maker and chipmaker measured by 2017 revenues),[5][6] Samsung Heavy Industries
            (the world's second largest shipbuilder measured by 2010 revenues),[7] and Samsung Engineering and Samsung
            C&T Corporation (respectively the world's 13th and 36th largest construction companies).[8] Other notable
            subsidiaries include Samsung Life Insurance (the world's 14th largest life insurance company),[9] Samsung
            Everland (operator of Everland Resort, the oldest theme park in South Korea)[10] and Cheil Worldwide (the
